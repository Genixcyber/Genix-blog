    One of the most popular websites at NASA is the Astronomy Picture of the Day. Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured, along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer.
    The official NASA APOD page displays a single image everyday, SpacePaper retrieves images for a specific Month and Year.
    APOD API allows us to retrieve images from June 1995 - Current Year.
    API Requests are handled by a python script and it generates a Javascript file which displays images on the frontend.
