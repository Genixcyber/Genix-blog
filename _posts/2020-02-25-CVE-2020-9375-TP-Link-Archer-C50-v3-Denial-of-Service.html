<div class="content white-text">
	<p>
		<span class="cyan-text">Vulnerability :</span> The Web Interface in Archer C50 V3 is vulnerable to a Denial of Service when anyone in network sends a specially crafted HTTP Header containing an unexpected Referer field.

		<span class="cyan-text">Type of Vulnerability :</span> Denial of Service

<h2 class="cyan-text">Attacking Setup</h2>
<div class="content white-text">
	<p>
		<span class="cyan-text">Connected with the router through WiFi/LAN</span>

<h2 class="cyan-text">Exploit</h2>
<div class="content white-text">
	<p>
		Let’s verify if we can access the gateway and port 80 is open
	</p>
	<div class="center-img">

	</div>
	<p>
		As we can see port 80 is open and we can access router login page.
		Now we will create a new text file, I used headers.txt as file name for this step, in this file we will input the headers we want to send with the request we will be making later on
	</p>
	<div class="center-img">

	</div>
	<p>
		I am using Host, User-Agent and Referer in headers, Host and User-Agent are in standard format and are correct but take a look at Referer, the correct format of Referer field is as shown below :
		<br>
		<pre><code>Referer: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript</code></pre>
		This is the point where the vulnerability is triggered, if we send Referer in incorrect format, the service on port 80 crashes and the port closes.
		<br>
		Now let’s try to trigger this vulnerability using curl, we will issue a simple GET request with the command below, to provide headers we will use -H argument of curl and specify our file which contains header i.e. headers.txt
	</p>
	<div class="center-img">
		<img class="responsive-img" src="https://imgur.com/NQf1cgH.png" alt="{{ page.title }}">
	</div>
	<p>
		In a normal scenario we get a status code along with the output of GET request but here we get Empty reply from server, which means the service crashed before it could reply and the connection was closed, now let’s check nmap again to see if port 80 is still open
	</p>
	<div class="center-img">
		<img class="responsive-img" src="https://imgur.com/MxL7zNA.png" alt="{{ page.title }}">
	</div>
	<p>
		And the port is closed, our exploit was successful and it resulted in a Denial of Service as the web interface cannot be accessed now until we reboot the router manually.
		<br>
		Similarly we can make a custom script and automate the whole process making it easy and fast, an example is shown below
